# Testing filters with Jasmine/Karma

## Objectives

- Write unit tests for our custom filters

## Instructions

In this repo we've got two filters.

The first filter is `FavoriteFood` - it will filter an array of objects depending on the `favoriteFood` property in the object. Test that this filter is filtering a mocked example list of people correctly (create a small array of fake people objects with a `name` and `favoriteFood`).

The second is a filter to remove all the vowels in a string. Test that this removes every vowel in any string given to the filter.

Make sure you run all the specs once you've written them and that they pass!
